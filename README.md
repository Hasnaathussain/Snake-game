# Snake Game

## Overview

This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the boundaries of the screen or the snake's own body.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation

1.  **Install Python 3:** If you don't have Python 3 installed, download and install it from the official Python website ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).

2.  **Install Pygame:** Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

## How to Play

1.  **Clone the Repository (Optional):** If the code is hosted on a platform like GitHub, you can clone the repository to your local machine using:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the Directory:** Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the `snake_game.py` file (or the cloned repository).

3.  **Run the Game:** Execute the following command:

    ```bash
    python snake_game.py
    ```

4.  **Controls:**
    *   **Up Arrow:** Move the snake up.
    *   **Down Arrow:** Move the snake down.
    *   **Left Arrow:** Move the snake left.
    *   **Right Arrow:** Move the snake right.

5.  **Objective:** Eat the red food to grow longer and increase your score. Avoid hitting the walls or the snake's own body.

6.  **Game Over:** The game ends when the snake collides with the boundaries or itself. Press **C** to play again or **Q** to quit.

## Game Features

- Classic Snake gameplay.
- Score tracking.
- Responsive controls.
- Game over screen with options to play again or quit.

## Potential Improvements

- **Difficulty Levels:** Add adjustable difficulty settings that affect snake speed or introduce obstacles.
- **Power-ups:** Implement power-ups that grant temporary abilities (speed boost, invincibility, etc.).
- **Sound Effects:** Incorporate sound effects for actions like eating, collisions, and game over.
- **Enhanced Graphics:** Replace basic shapes with images for a more visually appealing experience.
- **Menus:** Add a start menu and a pause menu.
- **High Score Tracking:** Store and display the highest score achieved.
- **Multiplayer:** Allow two players to control snakes on the same screen.
- **Level Design:** Create levels with different layouts, obstacles, and challenges.
- **AI Opponent:** Develop an AI-controlled snake that competes with the player.

## Code Structure

-   **`snake_game.py`:** The main Python file containing the game logic.
-   **`pygame.init()`:** Initializes the Pygame library.
-   **`display_score(score)`:** Displays the current score.
-   **`draw_snake(block_size, snake_list)`:** Renders the snake on the screen.
-   **`message(msg, color)`:** Displays text messages.
-   **`game_loop()`:** The main function that handles game logic, events, and rendering.
